# ProjectLogApp
App for capturing and updating project log informantion.

This app can be used to capture (and eventually report on) RAID log items for a project. RAID is "Risks, Action Items (or Assumptions), Issues, Decisions"

PySimpleGUI is used for the front end. Data is stored in a SQLite database. If the database file is not found, the app will prompt the user to browse for it. Eventually, when the file is not found, the app will create a new one. For now, please download the (almost) empty database. 

The create and update features work. To change records, click on the one you want in the record selector box on the right.

This is a learning project form (like so many others here on Git Hub!), any feedback is welcomed.
